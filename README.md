# UTI-Listing
Since I did a lot of work to parse all this out, may as well share it.  
 
In the process of building my script to bridge PowerShell and Apple's Choose File AppleScript command, I realized I'd created a very large list
of filename extensions/file types and Type Identifiers. So what the hell, may as well share it with folks.
  
The chances of me updating this myself is slim to none, but if anyone wants to add to it, I'm happy to work to make this better. Hopefully it will be of use to someone 
besides me.
